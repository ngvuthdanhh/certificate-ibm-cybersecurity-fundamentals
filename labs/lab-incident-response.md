# ðŸ”¬ Lab â€“ Incident Response Simulation  

## Objective  
Practice incident handling following NIST lifecycle.  

## Scenario  
A suspicious login was detected at 3 AM from an unusual IP address. Logs indicate failed login attempts followed by a successful login.  

## Steps  
1. Review logs in SIEM dashboard.  
2. Identify malicious IP addresses and block them.  
3. Contain the threat by isolating the compromised endpoint.  
4. Eradicate malware and reset user credentials.  
5. Document steps taken in an incident report.  

## Expected Outcome  
- Apply the 6-step incident response lifecycle.  
- Gain hands-on with log analysis & containment.
