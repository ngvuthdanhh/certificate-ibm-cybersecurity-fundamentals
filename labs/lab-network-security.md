# ðŸ”¬ Lab â€“ Network Security Basics  

## Objective  
Understand fundamental network defenses and practice configuring secure communication.  

## Steps  
1. Configure a simple firewall rule to allow only HTTP(S) traffic.  
2. Set up a VPN connection for secure remote access.  
3. Compare encrypted (HTTPS) vs unencrypted (HTTP) traffic with Wireshark.  
4. Test IDS/IPS alerts with simulated attacks (e.g., Nmap scan).  

## Expected Outcome  
- Understand firewall rules.  
- Learn difference between encrypted & plaintext traffic.  
- Observe how IDS/IPS detects anomalies.
